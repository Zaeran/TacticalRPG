- Create some new skills


PHASE 2 - Terrain types + advanced targeting
- AOE indicator (blue?) when hovering valid squares
- Target types (line, cone, AOE, cleave style, everyone, etc.)

- Face correct direction when attacking
- Can cancel Passing turn

PHASE 3

- Basic inventory
  - Character slots
  - UI for equipping things
  - Showing what is currently equipped
  - Basic equipment sprites?

- Status effects -> dictionary string/int of active status effects
- Animations for attacks
  - Testing that projectiles hit before applying damage
- Projectiles travel further when higher, less distance when lower
- XP and levelling up
- Levelling skills independently
- Learning new skills (how?)
- Levelling skills
  - Skill trees
    - Armour (better armour mobility, higher tier armour, armour enchantments)
    - Shield (shield defence, shield offence, shield enchantment)
    - Blunt (clubs and whatnot. Can manipulate terrain a little)
    - Potions (healing + poisons)
    - Mobility (movement, charging, stealth?)

  - Individual skill XP
  - Skill tree XP
  - Combined skill tree abilities
- Prepared skills - can have a prep state and manual trigger state. I.e. Mighty Swing: spend AP to prepare. Move slower while prepared. Deal lots of damage when triggered. 
- Special weapon/armour triggers for magical effects. 
- Critical hits. Deal X extra damage when version conditions are met. I.e. backstab skill, etc.
- Interrupts that can reduce AP, causing the skill cost to fail

SKILL TREES AND UNLOCKS
- Equipment unlocks the base skill in a skill tree. I.e. Swords unlock Slice, shields unlock Block 
- Using a skill gives XP towards skill level, and XP towards skill tree. 
- Number of points in skill tree determines skills that can be unlocked 
- Cross-tree skills are hidden until prerequisites are met 
- Skills can be leveled up further to provide more bonuses to that skill.
- Magic skill trees can eventually unlock 'Attune X item type', which can unlock the skill tree without needing a weapon or focus. 
- potions skill tree requires a potion making kit - 2 handed. 
- Enchanter tree?
- Skill use outside of combat TBD
- trap skills?


- Relevant equipment needs to be equipped for a tree to be active.
- equipment can be weapons, shields, focuses, accessories, etc. For example, a sword could unlock Blade, a shield can unlock Shield, and a water-attuned ring could unlock Hydromancy

- Aeromancy skill: wind direction on entire battlefield. Affects movement and arrows 

- Raise terrain -> Only works on rock. Buildings / water / etc are unaffected
