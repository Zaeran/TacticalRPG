SKILL TREES AND UNLOCKS
- Equipment unlocks the base skill in a skill tree. I.e. Swords unlock Slice, shields unlock Block 
- Using a skill gives XP towards skill level, and XP towards skill tree. 
- Number of points in skill tree determines skills that can be unlocked 
- Cross-tree skills are hidden until prerequisites are met 
- Skills can be leveled up further to provide more bonuses to that skill.
- Magic skill trees can eventually unlock 'Attune X item type', which can unlock the skill tree without needing a weapon or focus. 
- potions skill tree requires a potion making kit - 2 handed. 
- Enchanter tree?
- Skill use outside of combat TBD
- trap skills?
